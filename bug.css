The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors.  The `#myID p` selector is more specific than the `.myClass p` selector, so the style from `#myID p` will override the style from `.myClass p` even though `.myClass p` is declared later. This can lead to unexpected styling behavior if the developer is not aware of CSS specificity rules.
