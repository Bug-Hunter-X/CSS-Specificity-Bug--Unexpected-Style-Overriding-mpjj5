To solve the issue, understand and adjust the CSS selector specificity.  One solution is to increase the specificity of the `.myClass p` selector.  For instance, using `#myID.myClass p` would have higher specificity than `#myID p`. Another approach involves re-ordering the CSS rules; however, this can be less maintainable. A better solution involves thoroughly understanding CSS specificity and adjusting the selectors or the order to achieve the desired outcome.
